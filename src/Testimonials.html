                During the summer, our rabbit, Tonto, began to have severe redness and itching on his belly
                and feet. Through diagnostic testing, we learned that Tonto is severely allergic to over a
                dozens kinds of grass pollens. We've now been doing allergy injections for several months, and his
                itching and redness have nearly gone away. We are so happy that our rabbit is now well and eating. He
                is more joyfull and he is playing with our litthe daughter again.<br>Many thanks to your Hospital Team
                who took really good care of our furry friend and help us to pass to this trully difficult period.

                When Samantha, our Siamese cat, began sleeping all the time and urinating excessively, we
                brought her to see the specialists at Wisdom. After running a blood test, Dr. Winthrop confirmed
                what we all feared - Samantha was showing signs of diabetes.<br> The doctor put us on a daily routine
                to provide Samantha insulin injections, and showed us how to administer the shots. I really appreciate
                the fact that all the staff was really supportive and had all the needed patience with our family. Now
                my husband can administer the shots to Samantha every day.

                The staff at Wisdom worked tirelessly to determine why our three-year old Golden Retriever,
                Roxie, started going into sudden kidney failure. They stabilized her and provided fluids until her
                kidneys were again functioning normally. We learned just how toxic grapes and raisins are to pets,
                and Roxie is no longer allowed to roam unattended in the orchard.<br> Special thanks to Nora the
                assistant who took care of Roxie. She was really kind and helpfull. Now Roxie is getting better each
                day and she is very playfull again thanks to you.

                Take me to the vet is the only clinic around that will even book pet fish for
                appointments.<br>
                When our 13-year old Comet goldfish, McAllister, turned from silvery white to an angry red, we
                called around, urgently trying to find a veterinarian who could help. Take me to the vet not only got
                us in
                the same day, but also was able to diagnose McAllister as having a severe case of septicemia. The
                clinic team treat him very quickly and administrated a big dose of medicines. Thanks to your care
                McAllister is getting better each day. We even taught to bring him a new friend fish.
